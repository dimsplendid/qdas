tnl-dm3pes implements Domcke's density-matrix based method for
third-order 3PPE polarization. The program also implements
Meier and Tannor's non-Markovian propagator for dissipative
part of the dynamics.

In addition, tools for calculating 3ppeps data are included:

gen_3ppes.sh: prepare a matrix of tnl-dm3pes keyword files and
              PBS jobfiles that compute integrated signals at various
              coherence and population times.

proc_3ppeps.sh: process output of gen_3ppes.sh and generate 3PPES data.

tls.*-tmpl: example template files.

Example:

# compute peakshifts
./gen_3ppes.sh
for i in *.pbs; do qsub $i; sleep 1; done
# wait for jobs to finish
./proc_3ppeps.sh tls
cat tls_3ppeps.dat

# plot 3D graphic representation of the PE signals in gnuplot
set pm3d
set isosample 40
set contour base
set cntrparam levels 10
set yrange [0:200]
splot 'tls.ndat' w l
