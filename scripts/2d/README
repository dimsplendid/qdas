Files in this directory can be used as a template to setup a 2D job;
follow the instructions below:

0. Make sure that tnl-dm3pes_para.sh and tnl-dm3pes are both installed
   in $HOME/tools/ (or make sure to modify tnl-dm3pes_para.sh).
1. modify *-tmpl file to setup your own job. Especially:
   a. change filename (jobname) to reflect the nature of your job.
   b. modify .key-tmpl file.
   c. modify .pbs-tmpl file.
   d. change gen_2d.sh, especially the JOBNAME
2. run gen_2d.sh to generate pbs jobscript and keyword files:
   ./gen_2d.sh > /dev/null
3. submit the pbs job:
   qsub jobname.pbs
   The PBS job should process all .key file and generate an array of
   out files (.out).
4. If you are not using PBS, then take a look at submit_2d-keys.sh to see
   how to run all tnl-dm3pes jobs.
4. after job is done, call either proc_2d.sh or proc_2d_avg.sh
   to process the jobs. 2dspec output will be saved in *.2d files.
5. grep Sr= jobname.2d | tr -d "a-zA-Z=+:;,][|\\/_" > jobname-2d.dat
6. grep Sr_norm= jobname.2d | tr -d "a-zA-Z=+:;,][|\\/_" > jobname-2d.ndat
7. See plot*.sh about plotting 2d spectrum.

if .tt file is present, use proc_tt.sh to generate 2d data files (steps 5,6).

Useful scripts:

  * proc_peaks.sh: use 2danalysis to calculate amplitude of peaks.
  * proc_slices.sh: generate slices of 2d spectrum at different T,
                    see the script for usage.
