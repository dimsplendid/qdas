QDAS: Quantum Dynamics And Spectroscopy

Calculate linear and various third-order nonlinear spectrum
for a multilevel excitonic system using a quantum master
equation formalism; the dynamics can be generated too.

To checkout a working copy from Github:
git clone git@github.com:yuanchung/qdas.git qdas

The code uses exciton theory and non-Markovian quantum master equation 
to simulate quantum dynamics of multilevel quantum systems. In the code, 
the density matrix of a system is propagated using an efficient iterative 
Crank-Nicholson propagator. In addition, the code handles multiple 
external fields (laser pulses) and extracts third-order polarization 
from field-dependent density matrix dynamics, which enables it to 
simulate electronic four-wave mixing signals such as three-pulse 
photon-echo peakshift measurements. 

Shell scripts that help to setup and process 2D and 3PEPS jobs are 
included in the "scripts/" directory. For how to simulate a 2D 
spectrum, see scripts/2d/README .

Modules:

tnl-lineshape: calculates linear absorption spectrum for 
           multilevel excitonic system including homogeneous 
           broading and Monte-Carlo Gaussian static disorders. 

tnl: Time-Nonlocal Module that contains tnl-dm3pes and tnl-dynamics
